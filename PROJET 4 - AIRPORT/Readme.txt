All the project is working fine except that there is no file 
in which you can enter blacklisted companies before compiling
the project. However the blacklisted part is working fine if the user 
enters the company to blacklist in the program. 

If you want to enter Events to see if the part for reading events 
is working you need to enter a plane in the syntax imposed by the subject
in the file named Test.

If you want to see if all events realized during the running of the code 
are well printed in a file, you have to open the file HISTORIC or you can 
print it on the interface on our program.

Finally, our program is running on every operation system.
